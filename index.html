  <h3><time datetime="2025-07-13">2025-07-13</time> // Hello world!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my website! I'm making this to have a place to document my various experiments in coding, game
    development, and other miscellaneous tech!</p>
  <p>My plan is to make everything from scratch, as much as possible, and just have some fun with it!</p>
  <p>I recently lost my job as a software engineer, so I've found myself with a lot more free time and a lot of
    motivation to actually get creative and make some stuff for my own enjoyment! Hence, the website.</p>
  <p>Having some kind of journal to document my progress will be useful to look back on, and should help me stay
    consistent when the days start blurring together and I lose all track of time!</p>
  <p>So, with that said, what's first on my list? Well, I want to do something purely for fun, completely unrelated to
    my previous job. And it just so happens that there are some really cool game jams coming up soon! First the Kenney
    jam next weekend, and then the GMTK jam at the end of the month. Stay tuned to find out if I can teach myself Godot
    in less than a week!</p>
  <p>This is actually something I've been wanting to learn for a while, but I just couldn't find the time before! So
    honestly my unemployment couldn't have come at a better moment. Today I finished a basic tutorial project and am now
    bold enough to try just making a small game on my own for practice. I will report back how it goes!</p>
