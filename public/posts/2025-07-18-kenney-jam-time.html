    <h3><time datetime="2025-07-18">2025-07-18</time> // Kenney jam time!!!</h3>
    <p>I am writing this while awaiting the start of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney game
        jam</a>! This is my first jam, and I have yet to actually make a full game, so I am quite nervous about actually
      making something within the 48-hour timeslot. I didn't end up having as much time this week as I had hoped to get
      more familiar with the game engine, but I did have time to learn a few new things and practice using the assets.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from learning a bit of Godot, this week I decided to finish up the <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course on <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (something I am doing for my career to fill some
      knowledge gaps and hopefully, eventually, get a better job). I also deployed this site to <a
        href="https://nekoweb.org/">Nekoweb</a>, which is where I've decided to make my home for the time being!</p>
    <p>Now I must be off, as I have a game jam to complete. Wish me luck!!</p>
