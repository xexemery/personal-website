    <h3><time datetime="2025-07-13">2025-07-13</time> // Hello world!</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm making this to have a place to document my various experiments in coding, game
      development, and other miscellaneous tech!</p>
    <p>My plan is to make everything from scratch, as much as possible, and just have some fun with it!</p>
    <p>I recently lost my job as a software engineer, so I've found myself with a lot more free time and a lot of
      motivation to actually get creative and make some stuff for my own enjoyment! Hence, the website.</p>
    <p>Having some kind of journal to document my progress will be useful to look back on, and should help me stay
      consistent when the days start blurring together and I lose all track of time!</p>
    <p>So, with that said, what's first on my list? Well, I want to do something purely for fun, completely unrelated to
      my previous job. And it just so happens that there are some really cool game jams coming up soon! First the <a
        href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney jam</a> next weekend, and then the <a
        href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK jam</a> at the end of the month. Stay tuned to find out if I can teach
      myself Godot in less than a week!</p>
    <p>This is actually something I've been wanting to learn for a while, but I just couldn't find the time before! So
      honestly my unemployment couldn't have come at a better moment. Today I finished a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0">basic tutorial project</a> and am now bold enough to try just
      making a small game on my own for practice. I will report back how it goes!</p>

    <h3><time datetime="2025-07-18">2025-07-18</time> // Kenney jam time!!!</h3>
    <p>I am writing this while awaiting the start of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney game
        jam</a>! This is my first jam, and I have yet to actually make a full game, so I am quite nervous about actually
      making something within the 48-hour timeslot. I didn't end up having as much time this week as I had hoped to get
      more familiar with the game engine, but I did have time to learn a few new things and practice using the assets.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from learning a bit of Godot, this week I decided to finish up the <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course on <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (something I am doing for my career to fill some
      knowledge gaps and hopefully, eventually, get a better job). I also deployed this site to <a
        href="https://nekoweb.org/">Nekoweb</a>, which is where I've decided to make my home for the time being!</p>
    <p>Now I must be off, as I have a game jam to complete. Wish me luck!!</p>

    <h3><time datetime="2025-08-07">2025-08-08</time> // Game jam updates!</h3>
    <p>Hello! It's been a few weeks since I've posted an update, but I've been busy participating in lots of game jams!
      I've been enjoying it a lot, although it has been tiring. I have been using Godot for everything so far, and I
      feel like I learn so many new things each time. I'd like to eventually add a page on this site to show all the
      games I've made, and add some devlogs to show the progress. But for now I'll do a brief recap:</p>
    <h4>// Kenney jam</h4>
    <p>First, I participated in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney Jam 2025</a>, where I made my very
      first game! This was a 48-hour jam which felt like a good place to start, plus the requirement to only use assets
      from <a href="https://kenney.nl/">Kenney</a> or <a href="https://kaylousberg.itch.io/">KayKit</a> meant I didn't
      need to worry about making my own art yet. I actually ended up using Kenney assets for all three jams I've done so
      far, as it means I can focus on the gameplay and learning how to use the engine in different ways.</p>
    <p>The theme was POWER, so I made a small puzzle game about turning lights on and off. It's called Lights On! and
      you can play it <a href="https://xexemery.itch.io/lights-on">here</a>! I'm overall quite pleased with this one,
      especially considering it was the first game I ever made. I got some good feedback on it as well. I really like
      the title art I made for it too!</p>
    <p>The main thing I struggled with here was puzzle design. I ended up having to rush through designing the levels on
      the final day, because I had to spend so long bug fixing to get the main mechanic working properly! There are
      still a couple of small bugs in the final build, so I'd like to go back and fix those at some point. I reckon with
      the additional experience and knowledge I've gained, I'll be able to rework the code a bit as well, to avoid the
      problems I was having with checking the win condition for each level at the right time.</p>
    <p>I also intended to have more platforming mechanics in the game, but again, time was short, and it was really
      difficult to think up puzzle ideas under so much time pressure! I have been finding it hard not having much time
      to just sit and think about level design during these game jams so far, but it does make me very keen to try and
      work on some projects without the time pressure, as I think I could make something really good!</p>
    <h4>// Melon jam</h4>
    <p>Now, I intended to spend some time progressing <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> in
      between the Kenney jam and GMTK a couple weeks later, but I found it just wasn't what I wanted to focus on. I
      wanted to continue working on game dev, as I felt I had only just scratched the surface! So, I ended up
      participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/melonjam6">Melon Jam 6</a> a week later! This was a much smaller
      jam, and this time was 72 hours long, so it felt like a good mid-point between the Kenney and GMTK jams.</p>
    <p>The theme for this one was COMPOUND, which I found was a lot harder to think of ideas for. I ended up making a
      game called <a href="https://xexemery.itch.io/jeremiahs-compound">Jeremiah's Compound</a> that incorporates the
      theme in a few different ways. This was a very different type of game to Lights On! and I actually found it quite
      hard to make something decent within the time limit. I feel like if I had made it without time constraints, I
      would've added a lot more to the combat and dialogue systems.</p>
    <p>But, very importantly, through making this game, I learnt how to make a basic text box and UI! That was honestly
      the most valuable thing I gained from making this one. I also just felt way more confident using Godot this time
      around, and felt like I was getting the hang of things a lot more.</p>
    <h4>// GMTK jam</h4>
    <p>Next up was the big one, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK Game Jam 2025</a>. By this point, my
      <a href="https://nocturnal-sys.itch.io/">partner</a> (who has also been participating along with me) and I were
      both honestly feeling quite exhausted! We decided to take this one a lot slower. Ideally, we might have worked
      together for the full four days to make something amazing, but that just didn't seem like a good idea with how we
      were feeling.
    </p>
    <p>The theme for GMTK was LOOP, which due to being so broad, honestly made it really hard to come up with ideas.
      There were a lot of things I could've done, if I'd had more energy to dive in and learn how to implement them, but
      I wanted to keep it simple this time, because four days of doing pure game dev and not much else didn't feel
      sustainable.</p>
    <p>In the end, I kept thinking about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/formerteenheartthrob/reel/DAY_uA-STtb/">this
        short film</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/formerteenheartthrob/">Max Zavidow</a> whenever I tried to
      come up with ideas for the theme. So I decided to try and adapt it into a game. And I was mostly successful! You
      can play the game, titled Tricycle No More, <a href="https://xexemery.itch.io/tricycle-no-more">here</a>.</p>
    <p>This one involved a lot of cutscenes, something I had no prior experience with. I ended up spending very minimal
      time on the levels and gameplay, because it felt more important to get the narrative portrayed well. I also just
      didn't feel like spending ages designing platformer levels under the time constraints. To get around this, I ended
      up adding a timer to each level, so it was more of a speedrunning challenge. That way, the levels could be really
      simple as the focus would be on jumping to the end as fast as possible.</p>
    <p>Through making the cutscenes, I learnt so much about using animations in Godot! I'm really proud of the opening
      scene especially. That said, I ended up using a lot of await statements in my code, and I feel like there must be
      a better way to do that. That's something I'll look into for future projects. But overall, I am pleased with the
      outcome, even if the gameplay is a bit janky.</p>
    <h4>// Where I'm at now</h4>
    <p>So, this brings us to the present, and I am actually participating in another jam! I had signed up to a few more,
      before I ended up getting thoroughly exhausted from the past few weeks. Fortunately, they are all over a longer
      time period, so I'm taking it slow and just trying to make something small that I can learn from within the time
      frame.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am making a game for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2025">LOWREZJAM 2025</a>! The challenge
      for this one is to make a game using 64x64 resolution or less. I heard about this one after the Kenney jam, and it
      really appealed to me as a pixel art enjoyer. There are ten optional themes, and I was inspired by a few different
      ones to make a simple fishing game.</p>
    <p>I am really enjoying the process so far, as it's very different to what I've made before, and I also don't need
      to spend time on level design! I'm also creating my own assets this time around! During GMTK, I ended up using <a
        href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> to add a few extra sprites to the Kenney pack I was
      using, and it was really simple and enjoyable to do! I considered entirely developing the game in PICO-8, but
      since I have no experience with it, I decided it would be best to just focus on learning Godot for now. But it has
      been really great to use as a sprite editor!</p>
    <h4>// What's next</h4>
    <p>Coming up next week is the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/b1t-jam-2">B1T Jam</a>, which is a 7-day long jam to make
      a game using only 2 colours! There are also some additional incentives to use an open source JavaScript library
      called <a href="https://kaplayjs.com/">KAPLAY</a>, and since I need to keep working on my JavaScript skills for my
      job search, I think this could be a fun way to do that!</p>
    <p>I also managed to win a <a href="https://www.pyxeledit.com/">Pyxel Edit</a> key in the Melon Jam raffle, and
      while I had pixel art on the mind, I discovered that <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a> can actually
      be obtained for free, by compiling the source code from their <a
        href="https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/">GitHub</a> and following the installation instructions! It wasn't
      too hard at all, so now I have plenty of options for creating my own art assets going forward.</p>
    <p>Finally, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14">Brackeys Game Jam</a> takes place later this month, a
      week-long jam hosted by <a href="https://brackeysgames.itch.io/">Brackeys</a>, whose tutorials I used to learn
      Godot when I was just getting started. I feel like taking part in this jam will be a great full circle moment!</p>
