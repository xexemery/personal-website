    <h3><time datetime="2025-07-13">2025-07-13</time> // Hello world!</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm making this to have a place to document my various experiments in coding, game
      development, and other miscellaneous tech!</p>
    <p>My plan is to make everything from scratch, as much as possible, and just have some fun with it!</p>
    <p>I recently lost my job as a software engineer, so I've found myself with a lot more free time and a lot of
      motivation to actually get creative and make some stuff for my own enjoyment! Hence, the website.</p>
    <p>Having some kind of journal to document my progress will be useful to look back on, and should help me stay
      consistent when the days start blurring together and I lose all track of time!</p>
    <p>So, with that said, what's first on my list? Well, I want to do something purely for fun, completely unrelated to
      my previous job. And it just so happens that there are some really cool game jams coming up soon! First the <a
        href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney jam</a> next weekend, and then the <a
        href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK jam</a> at the end of the month. Stay tuned to find out if I can teach
      myself Godot in less than a week!</p>
    <p>This is actually something I've been wanting to learn for a while, but I just couldn't find the time before! So
      honestly my unemployment couldn't have come at a better moment. Today I finished a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0">basic tutorial project</a> and am now bold enough to try just
      making a small game on my own for practice. I will report back how it goes!</p>

    <h3><time datetime="2025-07-18">2025-07-18</time> // Kenney jam time!!!</h3>
    <p>I am writing this while awaiting the start of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenney game
        jam</a>! This is my first jam, and I have yet to actually make a full game, so I am quite nervous about actually
      making something within the 48-hour timeslot. I didn't end up having as much time this week as I had hoped to get
      more familiar with the game engine, but I did have time to learn a few new things and practice using the assets.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from learning a bit of Godot, this week I decided to finish up the <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations</a> course on <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> (something I am doing for my career to fill some
      knowledge gaps and hopefully, eventually, get a better job). I also deployed this site to <a
        href="https://nekoweb.org/">Nekoweb</a>, which is where I've decided to make my home for the time being!</p>
    <p>Now I must be off, as I have a game jam to complete. Wish me luck!!</p>
